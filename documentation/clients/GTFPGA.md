# GTFPGA {#gtfpga}

The GTFPGA card is an extension card for simulator racks from RTDS.
The manufacturer provides a VHDL module to exchange data via fiber optics between the GTFPGA and GPC cards.

The GTFPGA card is based on the Xilinx ML507 evaluation board.
This board consists of a Virtex 5 FPGA, Ethernet and Fiberoptic MACs and an integrated PowerPC core.

The PowerPC core is used to forward values between RTDS and the S2SS server.
