# Writing custom node-type in Go

This directory contains the required glue code for implementing custom node-types in the Go programming language.

Contents of this directory will be compiled into a static library and linked into 'libvillas.so'.

Have a look at the 'go.example' node-type implemented in '<villas-node-git>/go/pkg/nodes/example' for an example on how to implement your own node-type in Go.
